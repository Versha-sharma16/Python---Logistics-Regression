        "Ans - Key Assumptions of Simple Linear Regression (SLR)\n",
        "\n",
        "Simple Linear Regression is based on several important assumptions that ensure the validity and reliability of the model’s estimates and predictions. These assumptions relate to the relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y), as well as the behavior of the residuals (errors).\n",
        "\n",
        " 1. Linearity\n",
        "\n",
        "- The relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y) must be linear.\n",
        "- This means that a change in X results in a proportional change in Y.\n",
        "- Graphically: The data points should form a straight-line pattern when plotted.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "If advertising expenditure doubles, sales should approximately double — not increase exponentially or stay constant.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. Independence of Errors\n",
        "\n",
        "- The residuals (errors) should be independent of each other.\n",
        "- There should be no correlation between consecutive error terms.\n",
        "- This is especially important in time-series data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Errors in one month’s sales prediction should not be related to the next month’s errors.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors)\n",
        "\n",
        "- The residuals should have constant variance across all levels of X.\n",

        "If violated:\n",
        "You have heteroscedasticity, which can make significance tests unreliable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Visual check:\n",
        "A plot of residuals vs. predicted values should show a random scatter, not a funnel or cone shape.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4. Normality of Errors\n",
        "\n",
        "- The residuals (errors) should be approximately normally distributed.\n",
        "- This assumption is important for making valid inferences (e.g., confidence intervals, hypothesis tests).\n",

        "Ans - The method of least squares in linear regression is a statistical technique used to find the best-fit line for a set of data points by minimizing the sum of the squared differences (residuals) between the observed and predicted values. This is done by minimizing the sum of the squares of the vertical distances of the data points from the line. The goal is to find a line that represents the data with the least amount of error, resulting in an equation that minimizes these squared errors.\n",

        "3. Calculate residuals: For each data point, the residual is the vertical distance between the actual y-value and the y-value predicted by the line.\n",
        "4. Square the residuals: Each residual is squared. This ensures that all errors are positive and that larger errors are penalized more heavily.\n",
        "5. Sum the squared residuals: The squared residuals are added together to get a single value representing the total squared error for the line.\n",
        "6. Minimize the sum: The method then finds the specific line (defined by its slope and y-intercept) that makes this sum of squared residuals as small as possible.\n",
